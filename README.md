# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This application is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using React for building the user interface, XState for state management, Styled Components for styling, and Jest for testing.


## Main Components
1. App: Displays the Layout of the application
2. GameBoard: The component that displays the game board and manages user input.
3. StyledComponent: Created for custom solutions and reuse in the project


## State and Logic
XState Machine: Defines the game state and possible transitions:
- idle: Waiting for the game to start.
- playing: Players make moves, and the game continues.
- gameOver: The game has ended, and the result (win or draw) is shown.

Events:
- PLAY: Handling a player's move.
- RESTART: Resetting the game.
- RESET_IDLE: To determine the user's inactivity.


## Testing
Jest: Used for writing unit tests that verify:

- Component rendering.
- Correct handling of events.
- State management logic.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
